The poetry of Duckies and Robots


Dear colleagues:

Let us all prepare our minds for the upcoming ICRA Trailer(s), by reading this year's submissions to the annual ICRA Robot Poetry Jam:

http://trailer.icra2016.org/ICRA2016-duckies_and_robots_poems.pdf

Please vote your favorite poem here: http://goo.gl/forms/7w21FX1xMH .

We will award a special prize, a functional duckie-robot hybrid, to the author of the most favorited poem.


p.s. The 4 trailer episodes will be published on http://trailer.icra2016.org/ in the next few days.
